# Broken links finder
Quickly check a website for broken links! To start it up, simply do:

    ./activator run
    
for default port 9000, or

    ./activator "run [PORT]"
    
for a custom one.

Note that this is very much work in progress. Next step is parallelization using Spark for speedup (code is already inside, just need to set up a cluster).
